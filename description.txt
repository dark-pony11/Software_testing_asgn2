I integrated my Robot Framework tests with BrowserStack using a remote WebDriver URL and custom capabilities.
From Jenkins, the entire test suite was executed on Chrome and Firefox, and all tests successfully passed on both browsers.
These runs appeared correctly in the BrowserStack Automate dashboard.

I also attempted to run the same suite on Safari using macOS capabilities.
However, BrowserStack returned a generic WebDriver “unhandled error” for Safari, and the sessions did not appear in the Automate dashboard.
This is likely due to a capability mismatch or Safari limitations in the current BrowserStack plan.

Because of this, only Chrome and Firefox runs were fully stable and validated through Jenkins.
Safari execution was attempted and documented, but not completed successfully.
